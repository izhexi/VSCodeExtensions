# dart-import

A simple plugin for VSCode to change all Dart/Flutter imports to relative format.

## Features

Run the command "Fix Imports" from the Command Palette; all imports from your own package will become relative. Also, the "Organize Import" command will be called.

The only command added (so far) is "dart-import.fix"; you can bind it as desired.
