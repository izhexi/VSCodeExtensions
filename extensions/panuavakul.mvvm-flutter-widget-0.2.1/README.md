# mvvm-flutter-widget README

I was reading an article from Edrick Leong [(link)](https://medium.com/flutter-community/easily-navigate-through-your-flutter-code-by-separating-view-and-view-model-240026191106) on seperating flutter's `State` into `View` and `ViewModel` and I thought that it was a great idea. However, manually creating a folder and three files everytime I want to make a widget is a pain so I'm just making this extension for my own personal use. 

What this extension does it that it generate Flutter's widget file along with `View` and `ViewModel`.

# How to use

`CMD` + `Shift` + `P`

```
Flutter MVVM Widget: Generate stateful widget
```

Input the widget name in camel case and then select the directory where the generated files should be placed.
