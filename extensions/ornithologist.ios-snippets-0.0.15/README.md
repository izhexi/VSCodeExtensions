# iOS Snippets

**iOS Snippets** is a collection of code snippets for iOS/macOS development. And since Visual Studio Code already provides support Swift and Objective-C (grammar and language), this extension is all you need to start coding.

To install this extension, launch VS Code Quick Open (âŒ˜+P), paste ``ext install ios-snippets`` and press enter.

Below, all the snippets bundled in this extension. Fell free to propose new snippets using the [issues](https://github.com/ornithocoder/vscode-ios-snippets/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/ornithocoder/vscode-ios-snippets/pulls) pages.
